## Description
This repository contains the R script `run_analysis.R` that solves the following requirement:

```
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5 Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
```

## Steps to run the script

* Download and uncompress the dataset (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The directory `UCI HAR Dataset` should be at the same directory level as `run_analysis.R`.
* Run `source("run_analysis.R")`. Make sure you're working directory is the same as the direcory containing the script and the `UCI HAR Dataset` directory.
